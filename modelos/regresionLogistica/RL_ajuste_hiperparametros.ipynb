Alternatively, you can declare integer columns as doubles (float64) whenever these columns may have missing values.

Alternatively, you can declare integer columns as doubles (float64) whenever these columns may have missing values.

Integer columns in Python cannot represent missing values. If your input data contains missing values at inference time, it will be encoded as floats and will cause a schema enforcement error.

Alternatively, you can declare integer columns as doubles (float64) whenever these columns may have missing values.
